<p>The great news is that our little 45-year old airplane had no major issues this year.  We had both mechanical and avionics inspections going simultaneously and bought 1 battery, 1 ELT (emergency locator transmitter), and 1 very tired transponder (responds to ATC radar) in the process.</p>

<p>The subsequent test flight was uneventful, although those are always a bit nerve wracking.  Let&rsquo;s just say that I know where a good grassy field is just south of the Northwest Regional Airport runway.</p>

<p>It looks like we&rsquo;re ready for football season.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I get to play with some really neat consumer web technologies as I consult for companies around Dallas/Fort Worth.  It seems that check-in services like Foursquare and Facebook Places are everywhere these days.  Many of the tech industry experts say that the check-in itself is already a commodity.  To stay relevant, those companies now need to build additional value and depth into their offerings or leverage their platform to supply other partners with unique content.</p>

<p>One of my personal favorites is <a href="http://www.gowalla.com">Gowalla</a> based right down the road in Austin, Texas (ok, it&rsquo;s a long road).  My family has been loyal to them since our first smartphones arrived and haven&rsquo;t looked back.  Other than our common Texas heritage, they have always had a fun and engaging user experience and the absolute best artwork that I have ever seen at scale.  Period.  From what I hear and have seen recently, Gowalla has been building depth in their service that should be exciting to see in the near future.</p>

<p>Since the check-in is, at least part of the time, related to your travel activity, you will probably check-in if you find a nice dinner spot or the perfect secluded beach while traveling.  This activity fits perfectly with both the social and dashboard models we have at Traxo.  In fact, my integration with Gowalla just went live today!</p>

<p>If you visit the Travel Sites tab within your account on Traxo.com, you&rsquo;ll see the &ldquo;Connect New Site&rdquo; option.  Follow that link and look for &ldquo;Location Services&rdquo; on the subsequent page.  Gowalla is now listed as an option and we&rsquo;ll ask you to connect your account.  Once you have authorized access, we will begin pulling in all of your past check-ins in the background.  It takes a while, especially if you are very active with the service, because we have to stay below a certain rate when talking to the Gowalla servers.  Shortly, you will begin to see some very neat things happening.</p>

<p>First, you may notice some new historical trips appear in your account.  The Traxo platform is looking for activity away from your hometown, and now check-ins will qualify as a trip and you didn&rsquo;t have to lift a finger to catalog a trip that you might have forgotten about.</p>

<p>Next, you may notice some trips have new activities attached to them.  Take for example our real trip to New Orleans this past Spring.  We arrived at Lakefront Airport and checked-in.  Beignets at Cafe Du Monde?  Heck yeah, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;The one, the only&rdquo; after all.  NOLA gets a mention for a wonderful birthday dinner.  Look at the image below.  These activities were taken from my New Orleans trip page on Traxo, where our trip matching logic has woven these into and around air, car, and hotel bookings that were harvested from other travel sites.  Pretty slick, eh?   Almost like I had something to do with it. ;&ndash;)</p>

<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.chrisstevens.us/images/gowalla-activity-segments.png"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.chrisstevens.us/images/gowalla-activity-segments.png" title="[Gowalla Activity Segments on Traxo]" ></a></p>

<p>Finally, Traxo is also releasing our new <a href="http://chrisstevens.us/2011/06/five-reasons-why-your-traxo-travel-score-matters">Traxo Travel Score</a> feature today.  &#8221;Verified&#8221; activity is a big driver in that score, and Gowalla check-ins qualify just like a flight booked on Travelocity or American Airlines, hotel by Marriott, or Hertz rental car.  It&rsquo;s hard to make it any easier to get a great score.</p>

<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not a Double Black Diamond Executive Platinum High-Fivin&#8217; the TSA kind of traveler, you probably take several trips each year for business and leisure.  You do take vacations right?  I hope you do.</p>

<p>If you are a <a href="http://www.traxo.com">Traxo</a> member, you can turn those trips into some cool stuff and it is launching today as the &ldquo;Traxo Travel Score&rdquo;.  I usually leave the PR to the company, but I think this feature is particularly cool and can provide some great value to all kinds of travelers.</p>

<p>Similar to how <a href="http://www.klout.com">Klout</a> measures your online influence, Traxo can use all of your previous trip data to calculate your travel score.  Your score is a measure of your overall travel experience.</p>

<h3>5 Reasons Why Your Traxo Travel Score Matters</h3>

<ol>
<li><p> Better travel recommendations.  Ask your Traxo Buddies with the highest scores or another high-scoring member.</p></li>
<li><p> Build your travel reputation.  If you write about travel, we hope your score will be one of your best credentials.</p></li>
<li><p> Earn perks.  Watch for great rewards from our partners.</p></li>
<li><p> Get better service.  Travel vendors are excited to recognize expert travelers.</p></li>
<li><p> Compete with your friends.  Who doesn&rsquo;t like a good competition.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>When I was first introduced to Klout, I had a hard time identifying the real-world value proposition.  In their defense, they were pretty new at the time and may have been a bit stealthy in their positioning.  The real-world value definitely there, though.  If you are influential online and speak out about a product or service either postively or negatively, online or in-person, an astute business owner can see a measure of your influence and has incentive to give you better service.  Well, in theory, at least.</p>

<p>Your travel score will work the same way.  As you visit states and countries, spend nights away from home, and cover more miles, our system will find those trips and give you credit for those.  As, your score (your travel reputation) goes up, we hope you&rsquo;ll receive benefits from our partners and travel suppliers based on how, when, and where you travel.  Also, if you link your favorite travel accounts (airlines, hotels, car companies), we will give you <strong>more</strong> points because those bookings can be verified through our platform!</p>

<p>Finally, if you&rsquo;re thinking that you don&rsquo;t travel enough or always drive yourself, never fear!  It just so happens that my family fits nicely into that category as well, except that we avoid commercial airlines and fly ourselves.  Be sure to link your travel accounts because Traxo will always be looking at those for new activity.  But did you know that you can check-in with <a href="http://www.gowalla.com">Gowalla</a> on your smartphone during your trip and we count those check-ins as verified travel just like an airline or hotel booking.  More on that in a later <a href="http://chrisstevens.us/2011/06/fun-with-gowalla">post</a>.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://chrisstevens.us/2011/06/its-annual-maintenance-time-again/">this post</a> last week, we started the required annual inspection on our Mooney today.  This post covers the first few days of a typical inspection like this.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Get the airplane to the shop.</h4>

<p>This should be easy, especially since our awesome mechanic is at our home airport.  When I get to the hanger, the battery is not just dead, but completely and very pitifully dead.   Even the cockpit lights struggle to wake up from a deep slumber.  This is one of the big reasons that I try to fly every 10-14 days.  Your car runs almost every day and the engine and electrical systems receive almost constant exercise.  Airplanes (and their pilots) should be so lucky!</p>

<h4>Step 2: Take off a bunch of very hot panels.</h4>

<p>After fetching a fresh battery from the shop, it&rsquo;s time to actually get started.  I drive around the airport for about 10 minutes to get the engine warmed up and then head over to the shop.  We remove the engine cowling and start draining the oil.  Airplane engines are air cooled, so without the normal 150 mph airflow, those metal panels and screws were nice and toasty.</p>

<p>I typically hang around for a few hours after dropping off to look over the naked engine and prop and to help remove some of the 30+ inspection panels.  Removing panels on a Mooney can take from 1-3 hours depending on the stubbornness of the 10+ screws per panel that have had at least the past year to work themselves in tightly.  That&rsquo;s me on my back on the floor for 1-3 hours, but it&rsquo;s definitely therapeutic for a mechanical engineer that spends 10 or more hours a day in front of a computer.  The mechanic and I also share some choice words for the 1960s-era engineers down in Kerrville that left us so very little room to do anything inside the airframe.  Thanks alot, fellas.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Get out of Tom&rsquo;s Way.</h4>

<p>That&rsquo;s about the extent of my involvement in the process.  The key is really to get out of Tom&rsquo;s way (our mechanic).  While I was collecting grease with my face under the belly of the airplane, he&rsquo;s already well into his &ldquo;zone&rdquo; working around the engine compartment:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>compression and structural checks on each cylinder (roughly indicative of their health and remaining lifespan)</p></li>
<li><p>inspect the spark plugs, plug wires, magnetos, battery (hey, we have a new one now &ndash; that&rsquo;ll be $300 please)</p></li>
<li><p>inspect the prop, hub, prop governor, carburetor</p></li>
<li><p>inspect the air intact and exhaust systems</p></li>
<li><p>inspect the vacuum pump, standby vacuum system, firewall</p></li>
<li><p>about 100 other things all called out in the official Maintenance Manual for our specific Mooney make and model</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>What&rsquo;s Next?</h4>

<p>Tom will spend the next few days looking at engine, airframe, landing gear, instrumentation, flight controls, and the rest of the Maintenance Manual.  After that is a bunch of paperwork, engine and systems testing and sign-off, and a quick test flight by yours truly.  More on those items next time.</p>

<p>Most people I talk to don&rsquo;t know much about general aviation.  The closest I usually get is that somebody&rsquo;s dad was a pilot or airline pilot or they rode in a &ldquo;cessna&rdquo; once (yup, that&rsquo;s a lowercase &ldquo;c&rdquo; as if it encompassed an entire genre of vehicles).  It&rsquo;s a mysterious topic to most people, so I always try to relate it to something a little more mainstream, like cars.</p>

<p>Being the Statesman that I am, I&rsquo;m not going to lie to you.  Airplanes are expensive, like house or boat or Aston Martin expensive.  But! That&rsquo;s not to say there isn&rsquo;t some wiggle room. The older and less capable you go, the more affordable plane you can get into.  Most of us mere mortals will only ever be able to eek into a &ldquo;well-loved&rdquo; older model of flying machine, if at all, and that&rsquo;s more than adequate.</p>

<p>How about some numbers from the &ldquo;mere mortal&rdquo; class, but you&rsquo;ll have to reach back about 30 or 40 years&hellip;</p>

<p>1960-1970 Cessna 172:  $30,000 &ndash; $50,000
1960-1970 Mooney:  $35,000 &ndash; $75,000 (we have a 1965 Mooney)</p>

<p>Now if we move up to something really nifty and new (made in the last decade)&hellip;</p>

<p>2006 Cessna 172S:  $199,000
2005 Mooney Ovation 2: $300,000
2005 Cirrus SR-22 GTS: $270,000</p>

<p>I typically like to say that a &ldquo;well-loved&rdquo; airplane is roughly equivalent in purchase price to a sports or luxury car:</p>

<p>2008 BMW 6-Series 650i: $53,000 (Ebay motors)
2008 Z06 Corvette: $59,000 (Ebay motors)</p>

<p>Of course, the purchase price is only one of the costs of aircraft ownership and it can often be mortgaged out to 15 or 20 years.  You probably already have a place to park your cars, but you&rsquo;ll need a hanger or tie down on an airport.  Inner-city airport parking typically comes with a premium just like anything else in the city (it is valuable real estate, after all). We are fortunate to have a great little airport just outside of the city that is easy to get to and from during the crazy DFW rush hour.</p>

<p>Beyond those big items, you&rsquo;ll have other fixed costs like maintenance, training, and insurance; charts and database subscriptions so you know where you are and how to get home; electricity for the hanger if want lights at night. (We don&rsquo;t have lights at night.)</p>

<p>Often, it is the prospect of paying all of these fixed costs that really gets people interested in shared ownership.  There is a lot to like about shared ownership and we may try that someday.</p>

<p>In the next post, I&rsquo;ll talk about our ownership experience here in the DFW Metroplex and a few of our typical trips.</p>

<p>Each year, aircraft owners enjoy at least a week of downtime for FAA-mandated &ldquo;annual&rdquo; maintenance.  People often ask me how I feel about flying a machine built in 1965.  I typically respond with something like: Imagine if we took your car apart once a year, looked into the engine, analyzed the oil for contaminants and metallics, and applied a list of manufacturer required maintenance and safety items from the previous year.  You would see cars that last longer, perform better, and are safer.  By that same token, the design lifespan for cars is short enough to almost negate this level of attention.</p>

<p>We had a bit of concern leading up to our first annual in 2010 since the previous owner had owned the aircraft since 1979.  There is no way to really know what a fresh set of eyes will turn up even though we had a very experience Mooney shop perform the pre-purchase inspection.  Those pre-purchase inspections aren&rsquo;t required by any regulation, but I can&rsquo;t imagine making a big purchase without one.</p>

<p>Our 2010 annual turned out just fine.  I helped do some of the easier chores like removing panels, landing gear doors, etc.  All this helped our mechanic (Tom) get through the process 1-2 days sooner.  Probably more importantly, I had a chance to look in, over, and around many deep and dark places originally assembled more than 46 years ago in Kerrville, Texas.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have some new pictures and more details about the process as our 2011 inspection kicks off in a few weeks.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://chrisstevens.us/2011/04/04/flying-digital-ipad-foreflight-hd/">Part 1</a>, I talked about the benefits of going paperless in the cockpit with the iPad.  For this installment, I&rsquo;ll go over some actual early in-flight operations.  Mounting options, flight control clearance, and screen polarization are covered.</p>

<p>Both flights so far (1 IFR and 1 VFR) were performed with only the trial period of the Foreflight HD software.  That means that you can&rsquo;t bulk download charts and data for a whole region.  You have to lookup each airport and save all of the terminal plates and then scroll around the map area that you&rsquo;ll need.  Also, the &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; subscription is required to test the geo-referenced approach and taxi charts.  It would have been nice to be able to try this during my 30-day trial period, but it is a new feature and I hope it will be added to the trial at a later date.</p>

<p>Discarding the IFR flight because I hadn&rsquo;t read the software user manual yet leaves us with a bumpy local VFR flight.  Mooney cockpits are notoriously compact like a sports car, so the first issue is finding space for the iPad.  The instrument panel is full and the Johnson bar for the manual landing gear leaves out a lower-pedestal mounting option, so I&rsquo;m left with the kneeboard option.  This is fine anyway since I almost always fly with a kneeboard and there are some swanky new boards coming to market especially for the iPad.  The other issue with the kneeboard is that the flight control arm comes dangerously close to the iPad glass nearing full right deflection.  It&rsquo;s rare that we need full right deflection, but if we did, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that I&rsquo;ll have enough time to ensure that the pretty glass is safely clear before righting the aircraft.  I don&rsquo;t think Cessna drivers will have this problem, and certainly the side-stick (Cirrus and Lancair) guys are loving all their knee-room.</p>

<p>My next issue is polarization of the screen.  With my now 4-year old Maui Jim&rsquo;s, the iPad screen is completely black in portrait mode.  Rotate to landscape and all is great in the world except my space issue with the flight controls.  Also, the approach charts are portrait and look glorious that way.  If you wear (and like) polarized sunglasses, you&rsquo;ll want to check this out before purchase and preferrably in sunlight.</p>

<p>In the next installment, we&rsquo;ll cover building and actually flying routes.  There is at least one trick that you&rsquo;ll need to know before launching out into a real flight.</p>

<p>One of the on-going expenses in operating an aircraft is buying both VFR and IFR charts and publications every 1-2 months.  These aren&rsquo;t normally expensive either, typically about $8 per region, but our usual intra-Texas flights require 6 different publications.  Imagine then traveling across several states (our trip to Florida required 10 pubs) or the farther.</p>

<p>When the original iPad first launched, the aviation community saw some immediate parallels to the existing state-of-the-art electronic flight bags of the time.  Those devices, both highly specialized and ruggedized for the rigors of cockpit life, sold for thousands of dollars and had just one mission in life.  The iPad can do all that and much more with the right software.</p>

<p>After passing on the first-gen iPad, I picked up a shiny new iPad 2 on launch day with a plan to use it while flying in addition to the daily web consumption activities.  I&rsquo;ll have to tell the iPad2 launch day store later.</p>

<p>I almost immediately loaded a free trial of arguably the best in-flight software for the iPad: <a href="http://www.foreflight.com/ipad">ForeFlight HD</a>.  The maps and charts are gorgeous and bright and full color, whereas the printed publications come in any color you like as long as you like black.</p>

<p>The mid-size iPad or bigger can hold all of the charts, maps, and publications for the whole US.  Weight and volume are a big deal in light aircraft transportation and this device and appropriate software can replace an entire case of paper for cross country flight.</p>

<p>One of the big issues in a transition to digital is safety of flight.  Paper is pretty safe and not known to spontaneous combustion, so short of being tossed out a window, most pilots are usually confident that their paper charts will be available when needed.  With digital devices, people start to worry about failures, blue screens of &ldquo;death&rdquo;, backups, and the regulations.  I&rsquo;m not completely convinced yet, but I&rsquo;m headed down the path.</p>

<p>I also think the pricing model for the Foreflight software is pure genius.  With my annual subscription fee, which is far, far less than buying a year worth of paper charts, I can use the software on 1 iPad <em>and</em> 1 iPhone!  Woohoo!  Now, I have a digital backup for the main device and still don&rsquo;t need any paper.</p>

<p>In the next installment, I&rsquo;ll talk about my flight tests with the new system.</p>

<p>First posts are fun.  Sometimes it&rsquo;s just important to get started.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that this site will have a particular theme or focus, but I do frequently run across some good tidbits of data or knowledge that I&rsquo;d like to either share or preserve for later.</p>

<p>The photo is from our trip to Florida for STS-131, one of the last shuttle launches.  The start of a long and exciting journey for the crew and the end (or almost so) of an era of manned space flight that has been so consistent for my lifetime.</p>
