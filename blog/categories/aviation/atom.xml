    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote up some recommendations for a friend last week about aerial holiday light tours.  These were specific to the Dallas/Fort Worth metro area, but the general information is valid for almost any community with an airport.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.chrisstevens.us/images/starlight_downtown.jpg"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.chrisstevens.us/images/starlight_downtown-300x202.jpg"></a></p>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>

<p>Fixed wing tour flights are probably going to be cheaper (or longer w/comparable price to helicopter) and can usually be found at any of your local airports.  Most flight schools offer up their flight instructors to fly tour flights in the evenings when student activity is lowest.  You just have to ask about holiday flight tours and should be able to get a very new aircraft these days.  Older aircraft are fine, but newer is usually more enjoyable.</p>

<p>If you have both helicopter and airplane options available, you have a decision to make.  There is a certain novelty, even for me, with helicopter flight, but they are typically shorter and/or more expensive than fixed-wing tours.  Visibility out of the cabin may be better and the ability to get slow and take it all in is a definite plus for the helicopter option.</p>

<p>When you show up for your flight, your pilot should give you a short safety briefing and answer questions.  He will usually have a planned route for the best experience, but may also take suggestions if you have a specific neighborhood that you want to see.  Metro areas have controlled airspace restrictions, so some neighborhoods may not be accessible.  Take at least a light jacket and gloves along.  Light aircraft heaters are extremely effective.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-i9GXbptog">Boiling lava hot</a> effective, to be more specific.  The operator should provide you with headsets to wear.  These knock down some of the noise and provide intercom capabilities between the passengers.  If you are taking young children, ask the operator when you make your reservation if they have any child headsets.  If they don&rsquo;t have them, our girls wear these very hip <a href="http://amzn.com/B001ET5XAS">Peltor Kids</a> or a small adult headset with some extra padding.</p>

<p>Especially since the Dallas area had a serious injury already this season, do not EVER walk towards the front of the airplane or the tail of a helicopter without assistance.</p>

<p>Finally, watch this short <a href="http://starlightflight.com/flight-descriptions/christmas-light-airplane-tour/">Dallas holiday light tour flight</a> video (near the bottom) from one of the local operators and have a great flight!</p>

<h2>Dallas / Fort Worth Metro Area</h2>

<p>Epic Helicopter is an excellent choice and launches their holiday tours from Dallas or Fort Worth:

    <link href="http://chrisstevens.us/blog/2011/11/01/a-relic-flying-the-arc/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-01T06:30:11-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://chrisstevens.us/blog/2011/11/01/a-relic-flying-the-arc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.chrisstevens.us/images/kcll-ils34-arc.jpg"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.chrisstevens.us/images/kcll-ils34-arc-300x225.jpg" title="[ILS34 approach to College Station]" ></a></p>

<p>We had a great 25+mph tailwind during last weekend&rsquo;s trip from Dallas to College Station that cut our enroute time down to just over 1 hour.  With winds out of the North, Easterwood was landing to the North as any good airport should and there was also a light layer of haze that apparently kept most of the VFR (non-instrument rated) pilots at home.</p>

<p>College Station has a arc transition for their north-bound ILS approach.  Very few arc transitions exist these days due mostly to excellent CONUS radar coverage and GPS navigation.  Any transition segment, arc or otherwise, is designed to safely feed air traffic from the enroute system onto the final approach segment while ensuring terrain clearance.  An arc design may be used where a straight-in or angular transition segment is not possible, say for mountainous terrain or some other hazard.</p>

<p>Given our rather speedy trip and with both kids still asleep, I thought I would contribute to my required instrument currency and requested the full arc.</p>

<p>The Houston Center controller initially cleared us to the CINED waypoint just outside the ILS approach since we are GPS equipped.  I had to specifically request the arc portion of the procedure starting from OSUME waypoint, which was granted after some playful banter about my sanity.</p>

<p>Why arc transitions are &ldquo;relics&rdquo; (at least for non-GPS aircraft)?  Time and complexity.  The arc radius is 15 miles.  It added about 15 minutes to our approach over the radar-vectored transition to the final approach segment.  Also, they can be a bit tricky to fly.  Our GPS flew some of it perfectly and I flew the second-half manually.</p>

<p>Using the distance from the radio navaid (15 nautical-miles in this case), fly a heading along the arc for 10-degrees of radial change, turn 10 degrees left in the direction of the arc, and then update your nav radio by 10-degrees in the same direction.  The KCLL arc is about 80 degrees, so you get to do this about 8 times, all the while correcting for the wind.  If done correctly, the distance reading from the radio navaid should be nearly constant throughout.</p>

<p>Why would we keep such &ldquo;relics&rdquo; around?  For the day that the GPS constellation geometry leaves it unfit for approach usage and the radar at Houston Center goes on the fritz.  That&rsquo;s why we go out and practice them, too.</p>

    <link href="http://chrisstevens.us/blog/2011/10/18/by-the-numbers-college-station-for-53-dollars/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.chrisstevens.us/images/charlotte-flying.jpg"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.chrisstevens.us/images/charlotte-flying-225x300.jpg" title="[Charlotte Flying]" ></a></p>

<p>&ldquo;By the numbers&rdquo; in aviation essentially means operating the aircraft in a manner intended by the manufacturer and validated via flight test.  We have numbers for takeoff power, approach speed, engine rpm, fuel flow, etc.  Most of these are spelled out in the airplane flight manual and hopefully ensure safe and performant operations.</p>

<p>This post is more about the trip itself and addresses a question (or class of questions) that I feel like I answer frequently.  If it works out, it may turn into a series.</p>

<h2>How much does it cost to fly to &hellip;?</h2>

<p>This question, along with &ldquo;how long&rdquo; and &ldquo;how much [stuff|people]&rdquo; can be combined to formulate a total value of a trip or experience, so I&rsquo;ll give you our specs on a specific trip that we make very frequently via road and air.  My time is valuable whether used for work, family, or rest, so it always weighs heavily in our personal value proposition.  Yours might be different.</p>

<p>We are going to gloss over acquisition, maintenance, and other fixed (or nearly fixed) costs of both the aircraft and the car and just focus on this one trip.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the car sits in the garage or the airplane sits in the hanger, it costs what it costs and the value scales from there.</p>

<h2>Flower Mound to College Station</h2>

<p>Drive
Fly</p>

<p>Time</p>

<ul>
<li><p>8 hours round-trip (average)</p></li>
<li><p>This is for average traffic and approx 30 minutes stop time each way to feed the baby.</p></li>
<li><p>3 hours round-trip (average)</p></li>
<li><p>We can do this reliably even during DFW rush-hour and most Texas weather.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Cost</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$85.64</p></li>
<li><p>416 miles round-trip, $3.50/gal at 17mpg for our Acura MDX</p></li>
<li><p>$138.00</p></li>
<li><p>3 hours, $4.60/gal at 10gal/hr</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Pros</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Air-conditioning.</p></li>
<li><p>All-weather (basically).</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to stop more easily (esp. with kids).</p></li>
<li><p>Rush-hour agnostic.</p></li>
<li><p>Less fatigue upon arrival.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Total duration is brutal.</p></li>
<li><p>Leaving the DFW metro area can be brutal.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather can be an issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of air conditioning during the summer.</p></li>
<li><p>Pre-flight adds about 15 minutes to each leg.</p></li>
<li><p>Carseat install/de-install is a pain.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I typically feel quite a bit better at the end of each flying leg versus a driving leg.  Part of the driving fatigue is related to total duration, but I&rsquo;d argue that most flights are less taxing overall than the same trip on the road.</p>

<p>For an extra $53 on average, I save about 5 hours of travel time for the weekend.  Whether I end up working those saved hours or relaxing with the family, those are my hours and not wasted on the road.</p>

<p>The great news is that our little 45-year old airplane had no major issues this year.  We had both mechanical and avionics inspections going simultaneously and bought 1 battery, 1 ELT (emergency locator transmitter), and 1 very tired transponder (responds to ATC radar) in the process.</p>

<p>The subsequent test flight was uneventful, although those are always a bit nerve wracking.  Let&rsquo;s just say that I know where a good grassy field is just south of the Northwest Regional Airport runway.</p>

<p>It looks like we&rsquo;re ready for football season.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.chrisstevens.us/images/mooney-prop-vertical-e1308064417309-224x300.jpg"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.chrisstevens.us/images/mooney-prop-vertical-e1308064417309-224x300.jpg" title="[Mooney]" ></a></p>

<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://chrisstevens.us/2011/06/its-annual-maintenance-time-again/">this post</a> last week, we started the required annual inspection on our Mooney today.  This post covers the first few days of a typical inspection like this.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Get the airplane to the shop.</h4>

<p>This should be easy, especially since our awesome mechanic is at our home airport.  When I get to the hanger, the battery is not just dead, but completely and very pitifully dead.   Even the cockpit lights struggle to wake up from a deep slumber.  This is one of the big reasons that I try to fly every 10-14 days.  Your car runs almost every day and the engine and electrical systems receive almost constant exercise.  Airplanes (and their pilots) should be so lucky!</p>

<h4>Step 2: Take off a bunch of very hot panels.</h4>

<p>After fetching a fresh battery from the shop, it&rsquo;s time to actually get started.  I drive around the airport for about 10 minutes to get the engine warmed up and then head over to the shop.  We remove the engine cowling and start draining the oil.  Airplane engines are air cooled, so without the normal 150 mph airflow, those metal panels and screws were nice and toasty.</p>

<p>I typically hang around for a few hours after dropping off to look over the naked engine and prop and to help remove some of the 30+ inspection panels.  Removing panels on a Mooney can take from 1-3 hours depending on the stubbornness of the 10+ screws per panel that have had at least the past year to work themselves in tightly.  That&rsquo;s me on my back on the floor for 1-3 hours, but it&rsquo;s definitely therapeutic for a mechanical engineer that spends 10 or more hours a day in front of a computer.  The mechanic and I also share some choice words for the 1960s-era engineers down in Kerrville that left us so very little room to do anything inside the airframe.  Thanks alot, fellas.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Get out of Tom&rsquo;s Way.</h4>

<p>That&rsquo;s about the extent of my involvement in the process.  The key is really to get out of Tom&rsquo;s way (our mechanic).  While I was collecting grease with my face under the belly of the airplane, he&rsquo;s already well into his &ldquo;zone&rdquo; working around the engine compartment:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>compression and structural checks on each cylinder (roughly indicative of their health and remaining lifespan)</p></li>
<li><p>inspect the spark plugs, plug wires, magnetos, battery (hey, we have a new one now &ndash; that&rsquo;ll be $300 please)</p></li>
<li><p>inspect the prop, hub, prop governor, carburetor</p></li>
<li><p>inspect the air intact and exhaust systems</p></li>
<li><p>inspect the vacuum pump, standby vacuum system, firewall</p></li>
<li><p>about 100 other things all called out in the official Maintenance Manual for our specific Mooney make and model</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>What&rsquo;s Next?</h4>

<p>Tom will spend the next few days looking at engine, airframe, landing gear, instrumentation, flight controls, and the rest of the Maintenance Manual.  After that is a bunch of paperwork, engine and systems testing and sign-off, and a quick test flight by yours truly.  More on those items next time.</p>
