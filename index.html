  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are some impressive new database technologies making the rounds in the tech blogs and conference circuit. These products and projects become frequent topics of discussion among my group of colleagues and I thought I would highlight a few of them just to stir the pot a bit.</p>

<p>I work almost exclusively with MySQL as a primary datastore.  It is a great tool with open-source roots (more so in the earlier years. don&rsquo;t get me started) and street credit as the most widely used database system in the world.  Facebook might be one of the biggest known installations, though they use a number of different storage technologies and immense amounts of caching.</p>

<p>Many developers voice concerns using MySQL &ldquo;at scale&rdquo;, but I suspect most businesses won&rsquo;t ever really test those limits.  Even if they do, I believe there are more immediate concerns about durability that apply to businesses of every size and even at the early stages.</p>

<p>Sure, MySQL has replication. A slave instance or two should be enough, right?  Well, that buys you only master-slave or limited master-master in some cases. Auto-failover (and/or the subsequent manual recovery process) is tricky and sometimes downright dangerous.  What if you want to survive a data center failure?  How about running a global business with data centers throughout the World that all demand optimal localized performance?  Let&rsquo;s just say that it is non-trivial with stock MySQL.</p>

<p>Over the last year, I have advised my clients about the benefits of non-relational datastores whenever it seemed like an appropriate fit for the project or variations on the stock MySQL installation that they might be using already.  Some of those clients even intended to run globally distributed applications and wanted multiple data centers for fault tolerance and localized performance.  Unfortunately, some very promising implementations of the tools I will discuss below never happened.  I think this is partly due to MySQL&rsquo;s success.  In several cases, those clients had experienced few truly significant downtime events and an even smaller number of regional or complete data center failures.  These &ldquo;wide-area&rdquo; events <strong>do</strong> happen, and I believe the most successful and revered properties on the web take these threats very seriously.</p>

<p>Globally distributed applications often require localized performance.  We can do some work loading front-end assets from CDN edge nodes near the end user, but in the end, a long-haul WAN connection back to a database half-way around the world probably isn&rsquo;t going to be sufficient.</p>

<p>Do your homework.  Keep an open mind.  Experiment and Test.  Then, deploy and measure.</p>

<h3>MongoDB (<a href="http://www.10gen.com">10gen.com</a>)</h3>

<p>MongoDB is a document database and probably wins the name recognition battle for the entire NoSQL segment of data storage.  10gen is the corporate entity that builds and supports MongoDB and they have a phenominal developer outreach and marketing program.</p>

<p>From a developer&rsquo;s perspective, everything about the system sounds amazing.  It manages data as objects (&ldquo;documents&rdquo;) using an efficient binary JSON encoding mechanism., naturally aligning with the way developers work with objects in application code.  Mongo wants to keep all of your working set in memory to keep access times small.  Replica sets provide for durability.  Sharding for scalability, though I hear alot about the need to get your sharding decisions right from the beginning.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no shortage of blog posts detailing (seemingly) very reasonable concerns about operation of the system in real world applications even for which the system should be well suited.  There is also obvious trepidation among developers in general and backchannels full of grumbling.</p>

<p>To be fair, there are some huge success stories as well.  The 10gen.com website has numerous webinars from and talks by some very significant players across industries: Foursquare, Disney, MapMyRide, Craigslist.  I have watched most of those webinars and talks and there are real devs solving real problems using Mongo in products that I use every single day.  In fact, I can often spot urls with the &ldquo;guid&rdquo; identifiers that Mongo (and maybe others) use as primary keys.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am rooting for Mongo, still watching the videos and webinars, and looking for opportunities to use the system in my own projects.</p>

<h3>GenieDB (<a href="http://www.geniedb.com">geniedb.com</a>)</h3>

<p>A few months ago at Gluecon, I talked with the GenieDB guys and walked through the demo of their MySQL storage engine built specifically to deal with the issues I raised in the opening paragraphs.  Specifically, they appear to be solving the master-master and global distribution (multi-region / multi data center) problems that are usually just plain hard to do with MySQL.</p>

<p>At the conference, they demo&rsquo;d a Wordpress site backed by two database instances: one on the west coast, one on the east coast.  Using different browser windows, you could write a comment to the west coast site and see it update on the east coast site almost immediately.  They then stopped the database server on the east coast while continuing to make changes on the west coast.  Their storage engine held those changes until the east coast rejoined and was brought back into sync within a few seconds.  No primary key or auto-increment issues to worry about.  No app changes required.  Toss in some global latency-based DNS routing (i.e. Route53, Dyn, etc) and you could have a global presence with regionalized performance.</p>

<p>Genie is now marketing, almost exclusively it seems, a globally distributed MySQL as a Service.  This is also interesting.  They would like to de-throne the cloud standard at this point for MySQL: <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/multi-az/">Multi-AZ RDS on Amazon</a>.  In theory, the GenieDB DbaaS product would have the advantage because the RDS solution is not master-master and is not multi-region.</p>

<h3>Couchbase (<a href="http://www.couchbase.com">couchbase.com</a>)</h3>

<p>In almost every web or mobile application, system, or component that we build these days, there are certain elements that could reasonably be served from a cache without any loss in functionality or value to the end user.  Caching can take many forms, but my personal go-to solution along with thousands of other developers is <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcached</a>.  If you are new to what we call &ldquo;web scale&rdquo; systems, Memcached is a free distributed in-memory cache that a) just works, b) is trivial to integrate, and c) has been around for 10+ years with plenty of street credit as well.  It&rsquo;s up to you if you want to allocate excess RAM you have sitting underutilized on your existing servers or build a dedicated caching tier with high-memory instances.  Either way, you end up a vast amount of high-speed and highly available data storage for key-value pairs and driver support for almost every language.</p>

<p>Also while at Gluecon, I took a bit of time to listen to the pitch from the nice folks at Couchbase.  They were sporting some awesome bright red &ldquo;You had me at JSON&rdquo; shirts, which seemed to be flying off the rack.  I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to fully dig into the documentation yet, but the Couchbase server is a drop-in replacement for Memcached, a document database (like Mongo) that speaks JSON, and features <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.1.0/couchbase-admin-tasks-xdcr.html">cross data center replication XDCR</a>, auto-sharding, zero-downtime maintenance, and auto-failover.</p>

<p>Sounds pretty amazing to me and I haven&rsquo;t heard any significant complaining in the real world just yet.  I&rsquo;m still very early in my Couchbase exploration, but it seems like a real contender.</p>

<h3>Cassandra (<a href="http://cassandra.apache.org">cassandra.apache.org</a>)</h3>

<p>I know very little about Cassandra so far, but the stats about Cassandra from Netflix and Twitter are almost unbelievable.  Netflix uses Cassandra as a globally distributed primary data store with 1000s of instances.</p>

<blockquote><p>Cassandra&rsquo;s data model offers the convenience of column indexes with the performance of log-structured updates, strong support for denormalization and materialized views, and powerful built-in caching.</p></blockquote>

<p>Given a hard requirement for high availability, fault tolerance, and multi data center support without a requirement for a SQL (relational) solution, I would recommend taking a hard look at Cassandra.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I will be presenting at the DFW API Professionals Meetup on July 11, 2013 in Irving, Texas.</p>

<p>This talk covers practical API strategy, tools, and techniques used by Traxo during 5 years of bootstrapping in the travel industry. With few open APIs in the travel industry, the Traxo API provided an exciting avenue for commercialization and growth even at the proof of concept stage. We will cover technical aspects of productizing an API, working with enterprise customers, and how utilizing partners like 3Scale can minimize time to market.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here we are half-way through 2013. It&rsquo;s been an incredibly busy couple of quarters and I need to work my way through 6
months of back post ideas to get caught up.</p>

<p>I found that Octopress was just a bit easier to use than standard Jekyll and Jekyll Bootstrap. It took a while, but I
finally found a tiny speck of time to upgrade and port over the few old posts that I had.  Looking forward to easier
and more frequent posts now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been loathing my cardio workout options for years all while finding out that more and more folks around me that love cycling.</p>

<p>Flower Mound, as it turns out, is also a very nice place for road cycling.  Compared to Dallas and surrounding city-locked suburbs, we can be out in the coutry air in just a few minutes by bike.</p>

<p>I decided to start shopping in earnest in September.  After several months or research and visiting bike shops, and with help from several experienced cyclist buddies, I decided on a 54cm 2013 Motobecane Vent Noir:</p>

<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.chrisstevens.us/images/motobecane-vent-noir.jpg"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.chrisstevens.us/images/motobecane-vent-noir_300w.jpg" title="[2013 Motobecane Vent Noir]" ></a></p>

<p>It weighed in at 21.8 lbs (as delivered, post assembly).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll follow up with specs and gear in a later post.  The weather is here!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Too many projects, too little time. This is the story of the last year around here!</p>

<p>Fall is a busy time of year since we are always anxious to escape the confines for air conditioning as the Texas summer heat finally subsides.  Add two young kids, some traveling, and a rather exciting Texas Aggie football season to the mix and free time approaches zero rapidly.</p>

<p>I had suspected for some time that I wasn&rsquo;t quite happy with my Wordpress setup and the look and feel of the site.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I tried several Wordpress themes and plugins that claimed to enable support for any size of device.  Those didn&rsquo;t pan out, but the <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> based responsive themes were starting to mature.  I fiddled with a few of those before settling on something that worked, but wasn&rsquo;t awesome.</p>

<p>I also moved from Amazon AWS hosting to Redhat&rsquo;s new <a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/">OpenShift</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a>.  Wordpress setup on OpenShift is maybe a 5 minute activity and the whole experience was very, very cool!  It is a sign of great things to come in the PaaS world.</p>

<p>More recently though, I noticed a ton of posts by nerds similar to myself proclaiming the greatness of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub.
<small><cite title="Jekyll Documentation">Jekyll Documentation</cite></small>
</blockquote>


<p>Many of those posts had a similar title to this post and I dove headfirst into the rabbit hole.  I emerged several days later with this new site and a sense of freedom.  I also realized that I had been self-censoring if I didn&rsquo;t have the time research and write a comprehensive post on a topic.  I love reading detailed posts from others, but may have to be happy with some shorter posts (or series of shorter posts) to fit anything into the schedule.</p>

<p>Is Jekyll for everybody? Nope. Not even close.</p>

<p>If composing in your favorite text editor with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> sounds better than a browser textarea (regardless of how WYSIWYG it is), this is probably for you!  I can write in full-screen, distraction-free mode with my editor and focus on the content.</p>

<p>I still recommend Wordpress for nearly everybody else and Tumblr is a great option for very casual blogging.</p>
